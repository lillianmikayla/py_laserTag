# py_laserTag

We are using python 3.13.2 (latest release)

To get started, please install it from the official website. Should be simple.
Then, in your prefered command line, do the following commands:

Windows: \n
py -m ensurepip --upgrade \n
py -m pip install --upgrade pip \n
py -m pip install dearpygui \n

MacOS/Linux (i think): \n
python -m ensurepip --upgrade \n
python -m pip install --upgrade pip \n
python -m pip install dearpygui \n
