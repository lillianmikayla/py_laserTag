# py_laserTag

We are using python 3.13.2 (latest release)

To get started, please install it from the official website. Should be simple.
Then, in your prefered command line, do the following commands:

Windows:

py -m ensurepip --upgrade 

py -m pip install --upgrade pip 

py -m pip install dearpygui 


MacOS/Linux (i think): 

python -m ensurepip --upgrade 

python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

python -m pip install dearpygui 



Once you have this done, if you are wondering "How do I test my files" then my answer is "py/python file.py" (py for windows, python for mac/linux). More files? another system? im just as lost <3
